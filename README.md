# What is it? 


MusicBase is for the artists and fans, Connecting both. Artists get full 
control 
over their revenue while fans have the knowledge that artists get 100% of their 
donations and revenue. MusicBase is a streaming platform, a music video 
platform, and a connection platform. Fans can get exclusive track previews if 
they donate (this is up to the artists they can have track previews on by 
default.)
